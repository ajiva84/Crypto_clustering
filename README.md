# Overview

A novel approach to assmble investments portfolio that are based on cryptocurrencies. I have used unsupervised learning using open source libraries to
create clusters that represents the performance of the currencies. 


# Technologies

Python is the primary language used to code this application. Pathlib library is utilized to read and store the data. Pandas library to preapre and analyz the data. 
Numpy library for mathematical computation. Hvplot library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualization in Python, and scikit-learn machine learning library to data processing and optimizing the dataset. 


This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [CSV](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) - CSV library is utlized to read and store the data.
* [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - Pandas library is utlized to prepare and analyze the data
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html) - Numpy library used for math calculations
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) -  Matplot library used for graph plotting
* [Pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - Path library to provide local file path
* [hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) - High-level API for data exploration and visualization 
* [Scikit](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) - Scikit-learn is an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning.

## Installation Guide


Before running the application first install the following dependencies.

```python
  pip install csv
  pip install pandas
  pip install matplotlib
  pip install pathlib
  pip install Numpy
  pip install -U scikit-learn
  pip install hvplot
  
```

## Usage

Use the following command to run the app

```git to the directory and type
 jupyter lab
```
